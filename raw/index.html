  <h1>Math Testing</h1>

  <p>Check the source of this page to see how MathJax and markdown can be used correctly, both individually, and together.</p>

  <h2>MathJax</h2>

  <p>
    MathJax is the de facto standard for math typesetting. Normally, you'd install it using <b>TEX-AMS_HTML</b> configuration. Change delimiters to include $.
    The code for that is in this page source.
  </p>

  <p id="with-inline-math">Then, you can do in-line equations, like $E=mc^2$ or $e^{i \pi}+1=0$.</p>

  <p id="with-display-math">
    And you can do display equations, like
    $$
    \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
    $$
    or entire paragraphs of mathematical reasoning, with nice alignment, like
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    {d \over dx} e^x &= e^x \\
    \implies \int {1 \over x} dx &= \ln x + c
    \end{align*}
    $$
  </p>

  <p>
    This works by MathJax looking for DOM elements with math delimiters in them, and transforming their content appropriately.
    As the scripting at the head of this page shows, you can control which elements MathJax looks in; whether its formatting is automatic on page load or is
    driven by other scripts; and a bunch of other things.
  </p>

  <h2>Controlling MathJax</h2>

  <p>By default, MathJax typesets all math on a page when the page is loaded. You can override that behaviour<p>
    <ul>
      <li>by using the <tt>skipStartupTypeset</tt> option to disable any start-up typesetting</li>
      <li>by specifying the <tt>elements</tt> start-up option to define only those elements you want typeset</li>
    </ul>

  <p id="maths-to-format-later">
    If you do that, you'll have to typeset other stuff, like $y=mx+c$ or
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \tfrac{1}{6} n (n+1) (2n+1)
    $$
    from a later script.  Try it: <button onclick="typeset()">Typeset Math</button>
  </p>

  <p>
    The MathJax API is powerful and allows you to select the elements you want to format.  Initially-specified elements have to be by ID
    because the DOM is assumed not to have loaded.  Later-specified elements can be given by ID or DOM element.
  </p>

  <p>
    The MathJax API description of the queuing mechanism is a bit heavy, mainly because it was written a long time before most developers
    became used to routinely doing asynchronous programming.  In effect, <tt>MathJax.Queue()</tt> just calls asynchronous functions in sequence, so you if
    you need to make an asynchronous callback after all its processing is done, just code it as the final function in the sequence.
  </p>

  <h2>Markdown</h2>

  <p>
    The nicest way to enter text in general is using markdown, especially <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GFM</a>, GitHub-flavoured markdown.
    This allows you to write source text such as that on the left below, and then use a markdown renderer to convert it into formatted HTML.  Try it.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre id="markdown-source">
### Markdown section

This is **nice**: you can have
* lists, like this
* _italic_ and **bold**

And you can have code `inline()` and also block:
```js
var bar = function() {
  console.log('hello');
};
```

We can even have tables:

feature | supported
--- | ---
tables | yes, though fairly plain
maths | not natively: see below
        </pre>
      </td>

      <td>
        <p><button onclick="renderMarkdown()">Convert</button></p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <div id="markdown-target">
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    You have to actually choose a renderer.  A good client-side one is <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a>, which I'm using here.
    There are other renderers, and they should work similarly when it comes to mixing their markup with math, which is the main subject of this page.
  </p>

  <h2>Markdown with MathJax</h2>

  <p>
    So MathJax is simple, and markdown is simple.  But how about combining the two?  What we'd like is for the text below to convert nicely into "the right thing".
    In many cases this is obvious, but there is scope for tripping up: underscores mean one thing to MathJax and another to markdown, likewise vertical bars (pipes).
    So we can expect the "obvious" approach to have problems.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre id="math-md-source">
You _really_ need this to work.

Einstein: $E=mc^2$.

Pythagoras: $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$.

Series: $A = a_1 + a_2$.

Comparison: $1 \lt x \implies x \gt 1$.

Matrix: $A_{ij} = \sum_k B_{ik} C_{kj}$.

Fourier:
$$
\begin{align*}
F(\omega) &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{i\omega t} f(t) dt \\
\implies f(t) &= {1 \over 2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-i\omega t} F(\omega) d\omega
\end{align*}
$$

Polynomial equations:

linear | quadratic
--|--
$ax+b=0$ | $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
$x = -b/a$ | $x={-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}$
solution if $a \ne 0$ | solution if $a \ne 0$; real solutions if $\|b^2\| > 4ac$

Let's **hope** for an accurate conversion!
        </pre>
      </td>
      <td>
        <div id="math-md-target">
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    The obvious approach is to convert markdown first, then math.
    <button onclick="convertMarkdownThenMath()">Try that.</button> It doesn't work, because markdown does things with the
    underscores in the math markup and then MathJax never gets to see them.  There's also an issue with the pipes in the table.
  </p>

  <script>
    function convertMarkdownThenMath() {
      sourceElement = document.getElementById('math-md-source');
      targetElement = document.getElementById('math-md-target');
      var sourceText = sourceElement.textContent;
      resultHTML = marked(sourceText);
      targetElement.innerHTML = resultHTML;
      MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, 'math-md-target']);
    }
  </script>

  <p>
    It's tempting to try the exact opposite: MathJax first, then markdown.
    <button onclick="convertMathThenMarkdown()">Try that.</button> It doesn't work because we are taking the <tt>textContent</tt> of
    the MathJax output and converting it using markdown, but the <tt>textContent</tt> includes the leaves of a bunch of HTML elements
    which MathJax created, and this completely confuses markdown.
  </p>

  <script>
    function convertMathThenMarkdown() {
      sourceElement = document.getElementById('math-md-source');
      targetElement = document.getElementById('math-md-target');
      targetElement.textContent = sourceElement.textContent;
      MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, 'math-md-target']);
      MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() {
        var sourceText = targetElement.textContent;
        resultHTML = marked(sourceText);
        targetElement.innerHTML = resultHTML;
      });
    }
  </script>

  <p>
    The above result is useless, but it gives us some insight.  If instead of the <tt>textContent</tt> we feed the
    <tt>innerHTML</tt> to markdown, markdown ignores the content of MathJax's generated HTML, and just formats the base text,
    which is exactly the text which MathJax didn't see and which we want to format with markdown.
    <button onclick="convertMathThenMarkdownFromHTML()">Try that.</button>  It's pretty good: underscore and pipe work as expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do still need to use sensible markup within your MathJax:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>use `\|` for modulus: it formats better, and doesn't get mixed up with markdown table delimiters</li>
    <li>use `\gt`, `\lt` etc for inequalities: they format better, and don't get mixed up with HTML tag delimiters</li>
  </ul>

  <script>
    function convertMathThenMarkdownFromHTML() {
      sourceElement = document.getElementById('math-md-source');
      targetElement = document.getElementById('math-md-target');
      targetElement.textContent = sourceElement.textContent;
      MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, 'math-md-target']);
      MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() {
        var sourceHTML = targetElement.innerHTML;
        resultHTML = marked(sourceHTML);
        targetElement.innerHTML = resultHTML;
      });
    }
  </script>

</body>
